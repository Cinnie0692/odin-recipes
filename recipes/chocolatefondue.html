<p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>1 cup (8 ounces) heavy cream</li>
    <li>Pinch salt</li>
    <li>12 ounces milk or dark chocolate (chips or roughly chopped bar)</li>
</ul></p>
<p><h2>Method:</h2></p>
<p><ol>
    <li><b>Heat the cream:</b><br>
    Heat the cream with a pinch of salt over medium heat in a small saucepan until tiny bubbles show and begins to lightly and slowly simmer.</li>
    <li><b>Remove from heat and add the chocolate:</b><br>
    Remove from heat, add the chocolate, and whisk until smooth and fully incorporated.</li>
    <li><b>Serve immediately:</b><br>
        Transfer the chocolate mix to a fondue pot heated at low or with a low flame, or serve straight from the pot.<br>
    Arrange the dip-ables on a platter or plates around the chocolate pot.<br>
 Use a fondue fork, bamboo skewer, seafood fork, or a salad fork to dip the fruit pieces and other dip-ables into the hot melted chocolate mixture. Eat immediately.<br>
 If the fondue begins to feel a little stiff, add a tablespoon of heavy cream and stir. It will help it go a little longer. Eventually, it will cook down though, and you may need to start a new pot.
